This code is intended to help optimize surface based image reconstruction for any probe design and dataset as outlined in "PAPER NAME". There are two main sections. 1) Using data augmentation to explore the iamge reconstruction parameter space and 2) validate the optimal parameter combinations on real data. 

Requirements: 
This code is deisgned to run used Cedalion v24 - please refer to their GitHub (LINK) to install the repository and all required dependencies. 

This code can be run in two ways. If you have access to qsub batch job submission, then running both sections using batch jobs will greatly speed up the processing time. If not, there is a script version that can be run instead. Both will provide the data required generate the figures shown in the paper so parameter selection.
